u're new to the Linux Command Line and truth be told, you might be a little intimidated. Coming from the comfort of a PC or Mac desktop, the Linux Command Line (CLI) looks nothing like what you normally use. The Linux CLI is dark, it's secretive, it's bare bones minimal and it's anything but friendly to newcomers. And yet, the Linux CLI is highly useful, essential to using your Linux box or virtual machine and can, if done right, provide you with more insight and practical use than the Windows or Mac desktop ever could.
